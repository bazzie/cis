# ===========================
#
# AIDE is a file integrity checking tool, similar in nature to Tripwire. While it cannot prevent intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the files are changed. When setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation before proceeding.
