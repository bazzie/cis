#
# The yum update utility performs software updates, including dependency analysis, based
# on repository metadata and can be run manually from the command line, invoked from one
# of the provided front-end tools, or configured to run automatically at specified intervals.

# The yum update utility is the preferred method to update software since it checks for
# dependencies and ensures that the software is installed correctly. Refer to your local patch
# management procedures for the method used to perform yum updates.
