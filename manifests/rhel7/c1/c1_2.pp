# Class: cis::rhel7::c1::c1_2
# ===========================
#
#Red Hat uses the yum command line tool to install and update software packages. Updating the RHEL7 software via the Internet requires a valid Red Hat subscription. Patch management procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises may choose to install a Red Hat Satellite Update server that can be used in place of Red Hat's servers, whereas a single deployment of a Red Hat system may prefer to get updates from Red Hat's servers. Updates can be performed automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for patch management. Many large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-production system before rolling out to production.
#For the purpose of this benchmark, the requirement is to ensure that a patch management system is configured and maintained. The specifics on patch update procedures are left to the organization.
